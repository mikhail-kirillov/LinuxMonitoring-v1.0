# LinuxMonitoring-v1.0

School 21 | Linux basic bash scripting and system research

## About the Project

- **For each task, a folder must be created with a name like: 0x, where x
   is the task number.**
- **All scripts must be decomposed and divided into
   several files.**
- **The main script file for each job should be called
   main.sh.**
- **All scripts must have checks for incorrect input (not all
   parameters are specified, incorrectly formatted parameters, etc.).**
- **All written scripts must be run on an Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS virtual
   machine.**

## Getting Started

To start using the scripts, clone this repository to your local computer or Linux server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikhail-kirillov/LinuxMonitoring-v1.0.git
cd LinuxMonitoring-v1.0
chmod +x */*.sh
```

## About the Tasks

**The first task in folder 01**: Bash script that runs with one string argument and outputs it. Otherwise an error will be displayed.

**Second task in folder 02**: The script displays information about the system. After output, it offers to save the information to a `.status` file.

**Third task in folder 03**: The script is launched with four number arguments (from 1 to 6) and displays information from the second task with a new visual design. This assignment uses the code written in assignment two.

- *Color designations: (1 - white, 2 - red, 3 - green, 4 - blue, 5 - purple, 6 - black)*
- *Parameter 1 is the background of the value names (HOSTNAME, TIMEZONE, USER, etc.)*
- *Parameter 2 is the font color of the value names (HOSTNAME, TIMEZONE, USER, etc.)*
- *Parameter 3 is the background of the values (after the '=' sign)*
- *Parameter 4 is the font color of the values (after the '= sign)*

**Job four in folder 04**: The script does the same thing as job three, but uses the values in the `.conf` file to change the output visual. If there are no values in it, the default values are used. This assignment uses the code written in assignment three.

**Fifth task in folder 05**: The script is launched with an argument - the path to the folder (relative or absolute), after which information about this folder is displayed:

- *Total number of folders, including subfolders*
- *Top 5 folders with the largest weight in descending order (path and size)*
- *Total number of files*
- *Number of configuration files (with `.conf` extension)*
- *Text files*
- *Executable files*
- *Logs (files with .log extension)*
- *Archives*
- *Symbolic links*
- *Top 10 files with the largest weight in descending order (path, size and type)*
- *Top 10 executable files with the largest weight in descending order (path, size and hash)*
- *Script execution time*
